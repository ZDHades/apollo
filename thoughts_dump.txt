Okay I want to start a new project with you. I need you to fetch me some property lots in MA that I can use for a solar project. I have a lot of invariable constraints and you have the freedom to decide your tools, processes and methodologies.
Hard constraints:
Grid Interconnection;
1) Feeder Congestion
2) Distance to substation
3) Hosting capicity
4) Phase
5) Utility territory (national grid vs eversource)

Locations to check MA Clean Energy Center (mass CEC) hosting capicity map. 
Utility hosting capicity maps (eversource /n-grid)

Green / yellow circuits == viable
Zoning;
Is ground mounted solar allowed
by right vs special permit vs prohibited
max system size thresholds
accessory vs primary use ruels
hidden gotchasn on-site load max MW size caps

Check town zoning bylaws "energy systems" "solar" sections
Planning board dceisions (precedent matters more than rules)
Conditions
Wetlands, buffers, conservation traps
Check for 
Wetlands (DEP)
100' buffer zones
vernal pools
priority Habitats / estimated habitats
floodplains

How to check;
MassGIS Map Viewer
NHESP Map Tool
Town conversation comission GIS layers
Political/social risk;
Adjacent residential uses
Scenic Roads
School Bus routes
HOA proximity


How to check;
Planning board meetings: search for "solar" 
town facebook groups
appeals in land courts
Soil & topography;
slope > 10-15%
ledge
hydric soils
former fill


Check in 
USDA web soil survey
Lidar slope maps (MssGIS)

Accessibility and Buildability
Legal frontage
weight limits on roads
colverts / bridges
construction access width

Check:
assessor maps
DPW conversations
google street view + truck logic
titles & Encumberances

Conservation restrictions (CRs)
Agricultural preservation restrictions (APRs)
Old easements 
Utility ROWs

How to check

Registry of deeds - "CR" "API" "Deed restriction" "Recorded plan"
Positive signals;
Closed landfills
MssDEP landfill list
town DPW maps
Closed landfill solar searches

Industrial / Commercial parcels
easier zoning
better grid access
warehoues/ old mills / industrial parks / big flat rooftops (parking garages)

Municipal land;
Town controls zoning, faster approvals
lower lease friction
DPW Yards, old water treatmend land, town owned surplus parcels.

As you can see this is an exhaustive list of features, this will require several regularly updating ingestion pipelines, rich data sources, and heavy compute with rigorous logical requirements with a clean UI. 

You will need to manage this project entirely, I am available as you need for advice and validations. There need to be lots of validations at every step. 

If you foresee needing any skills or access to tools or special permissions, you may request them at any time.
Goal:
Identify land parcels that would be ideal for lease/purchase for solar energy generation in Massachusetts given the set of constraints above.

High level planning Instructions:

1) Requirements planning  - Using the provided starter set of features, curate a list of all attributes a parcel of land can have. 

2) Data gathering - Create sustainable production scale ingestion pipelines to gather all required from public sources and identify any sources from paid vendors. 

3) Compute - Identify, rank and sort all parcels based on their feature sets. 

4) Visualization - I want to be able to look at a GIS map and see the important metrics on an app that updates regularly.
